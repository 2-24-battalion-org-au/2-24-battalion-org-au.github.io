<p>This item is from Eric Edwards VX31279</p>
<p>I am enclosing an article and brief story you may like to include in the "Furphy Flyer". I was taken prisoner of war at Tobruk on the 1st May 1941, because we had run out of ammunition in that section. Two days later, i.e. on the 3rd May, a German officer invited me and some other POWs standing nearby, to write a letter of not more than 25 words to our relatives, and he promised that they would be dropped by plane over British lines.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly done for the letter which I wrote at that time was received by my mother. In fact, it was the first real indication she had that I was a POW. She had received notification that I was "missing believed prisoner of war" but not that I was a POW. I wrote on a scrap of paper, about 7 inches by 5 1/4 inches and, as I had no envelope, I folded it over and tucked the peaks in so that the finished article was about 2 3/4 inches by 2 inches in size.</p>
<p>The two dark "patches" represent the brown paper adhesive used by the Censor to seal it so that it would not come undone while in transit.</p>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>I have been taken a prisoner of war without wounds at Tobruk. I am in good health.<br />
   There is no cause for worry. I will write as soon as possible. Advise others.</p>
<p>Your loving son, Eric.</p>

<p>Mrs Beverley Weir sent this item in. It is a copy of a leaflet dropped on Australian troops at Tobruk. Her uncle was Thomas Ingham, VX30904, KIA.<br />
(Keith Clark tells me they came in very handy as toilet paper!)</p>
