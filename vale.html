<h1>WE WILL REMEMBER THEM</h1>
<p>They shall grow not old,
As we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them,
Nor the years condemn,
At the going down of the sun
And in the morning
We will remember them.</p>
<p>-- <em>Laurence Binyon (1869-1943)</em></p>
<p>The 2/24 battalion remembers these members and pays tribute to their memory and give thanks for their contribution.</p>
