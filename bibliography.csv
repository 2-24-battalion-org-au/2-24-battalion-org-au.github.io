The DVD is a summary narration of the book and includes a separate section of Movietone and Cinesound newsreels with many aspects of Tobruk - including the opening of the German Memorial in Tobruk! Made by Filmworld which appears to have been acquired by ThoughtEquityMotion (a US company with an office in Sydney) and who now have release rights to Cinesound and Movietone.

This contains newsreel of El Alamein and American newsreels of Tunisia, but it also contains an interview with Alan Macfarlane (currently President of the 2/24th Battalion Assoc) and covers from Benghazi through to withdrawal from Tobruk.
